# Note Taker

## Description
This is a note taking app that was created from starter code. The front end of the application was given, but it was completely nonfunctional. The functionality was created by making a backend to handle HTML routes. The user can view persistent notes, create new ones, and delete unwanted ones. This app was built using Node, Express, and Heroku.

## Usage Instructions
Click on "Get Started" to navigate to the notes. Notes will be displayed on the left, click on them to view them. To delete a note, click on the red trashcan. To create a new note, click on the plus icon in the upper right hand corner. Enter a title and text, then click on the save icon that will appear next to the plus icon.

## Local Use Instructions
If using the program locally, navigate to the directory it is stored in and run these commands from the terminal:

```
npm i && npm start
```

After running these commands, navigate to http://localhost:3001 and use as normal. To end the program, press ctrl + c in the terminal.
